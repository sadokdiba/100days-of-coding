# 100 Days of Code: Python Journey 🚀🐍

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code** challenge repository! 🎉 This is my commitment to coding daily for 100 days, primarily focusing on **Python** as a server-side language. Follow along as I document my growth, tackle new challenges, and refine my skills through consistent practice and learning.

## 📂 Project Structure

Each day's progress is stored in its respective folder (`day_XX`), where:
- **`day_XX/`** contains the code and notes for that day's challenges and features.
- Updates to previous days' code are also committed as I iterate and improve on earlier solutions or add new features.
