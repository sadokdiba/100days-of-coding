# 100 Days of Code: Python Journey üöÄüêç

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code** challenge repository! üéâ This is my commitment to coding daily for 100 days, primarily focusing on **Python** as a server-side language. Follow along as I document my growth, tackle new challenges, and refine my skills through consistent practice and learning.

---

## üìÇ Project Structure

Each day's progress is stored in its respective folder inside the `projects` folder from the main directory (`day_XX_"project_description"`), where:
- **`day_XX/`** contains the code and notes for that day's projects and features.
- A **`"day"`** could span over several day depending on the difficulty as the idea is to code every single day.
- Updates to previous days' code are also committed as I iterate and improve on earlier solutions or add new features.

### Breaking Changes
If a commit introduces a **breaking change** (something that is not backward compatible), include a `!` after the prefix. Add details about the breaking change in the commit body.

Example:
```text
feat!: update authentication API to use OAuth 2.0
BREAKING CHANGE: The `login` API endpoint has been removed. Use the `oauth/token` endpoint instead.
```

### Branch Naming Conventions
- `feat/<feature-name>`: New features
- `fix/<bug-name>`: Bug fixes
- `chore/<task-name>`: Maintenance tasks
